## **Data Shared With Third Parties**

ProWorkforceX will collect End User Data necessary to provide the ProWorkforceX services to our customers. End users may voluntarily provide us with the information they have made available on social media websites. If you provide us with such information, we may collect publicly available information from the social media websites you have indicated. You can control how much of your information social media websites make public by visiting these websites and changing your privacy settings.

## **External Data Collection**

We receive some information from third parties when you contact us. For example, when you submit your email address to us to show interest in becoming a ProWorkforceX customer, we receive information from a third party that provides automated fraud detection services to ProWorkforceX. We also occasionally collect information that is made publicly available on social media websites. You can control how much of your information social media websites make public by visiting these websites and changing your privacy settings.

## **How We Share Your Information**

1.  We may share the information that we collect, both personal and non-personal, with third parties such as advertisers, contest sponsors, promotional and marketing partners, and others who provide our content or whose products or services we think may interest you. We may also share it with our current and future affiliated companies and business partners. If we are involved in a merger, asset sale, or other business reorganisation, we may share or transfer your personal and non-personal information to our successors-in-interest.
2.  We may engage trusted third-party service providers to perform functions and provide services to us, such as hosting and maintaining our servers and the website, database storage and management, email management, storage marketing, credit card processing, customer service, and fulfilling orders for products and services you may purchase through the website. We will likely share your personal and possibly some non-personal information with these third parties to enable them to perform these services for us and you.
3.  We may share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, for analytics purposes with third parties such as web analytics partners, application developers, and ad networks. If your IP address is shared, it may be used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection speed, whether you have visited the website in a shared location, and the type of device used to visit it. They may aggregate information about our advertising and what you see on the website and provide auditing, research, and reporting for us and our advertisers.
4.  We may also disclose personal and non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal processes (including subpoenas) to protect our rights and interests, or those of a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, laws, rules and regulations.

## **Email Address Usage**

1.  By submitting your email address on this website, you agree to receive emails from us. You can cancel participation in these email lists by clicking the opt-out link or other unsubscribe options in the email. We only email people authorised to contact them directly or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails because we hate spam as much as you do.
2.  By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us. Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used to send you information and updates about your order. If, however, you have provided the same email to us through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy. Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

## **How We Safeguard Your Data**

1.  We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers’ database only to be accessible by those authorised with special access rights to such systems and are required to keep the information confidential.
2.  After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to ProWorkforceX or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

## **Ensuring Data Security**

1.  We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorised access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems.
2.  In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes, or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standard to measure our compliance with that duty.

## **Your Rights to Modify Data**

1.  Your rights to request updates or corrections to the information ProWorkforceX collects depend on your relationship with ProWorkforceX. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal company employment policies.
2.  Customers have the right to request the restriction of specific uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information. You can contact us to:
    - Update or correct your personally identifiable information.
    - Change your preferences concerning communications and other information you receive from us.
    - Cancelling your account will delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph).

3.  Such updates, corrections, changes, and deletions will not affect other information that we maintain or have provided to third parties by this Privacy Policy before such updates, corrections, changes, or deletions. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information.
4.  You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove every record of the information you have provided us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from accidental loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed, or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.

## **Sharing Information With Affiliates**

We may disclose information (including personal information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Corporate Affiliate” means any person or entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with ProWorkforceX, whether by ownership or otherwise. Those Corporate Affiliates will treat any information relating to you that we provide to our Corporate Affiliates following the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## **Applicable Laws**

1.  The laws of the United Kingdom govern this Privacy Policy without regard to its conflict of laws provision. You consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in connection with any action or dispute arising between the parties under or in connection with this Privacy Policy.
2.  The laws of the United Kingdom, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Agreement and your use of the website. Your website use may also be subject to local, state, national, or international laws.
3.  Using ProWorkforceX or contacting us directly signifies your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you disagree with this Privacy Policy, you should not engage with our website or use our services. Continued use of the website, direct engagement with us, or following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy that do not significantly affect the use or disclosure of your personal information will mean that you accept those changes.

## **Your Consent to Data Use**

We’ve updated our Privacy Policy to provide complete transparency into what is set when you visit our site and its use. By using our website, registering an account, or purchasing, you now consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.

## **Child Privacy Protection**

We do not address anyone under 18 and do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 18. If you are a parent or guardian and know that your child has provided us with Personal Data, please get in touch with us. Suppose we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 18 without verification of parental consent. In that case, we will remove that information from our servers.

## **Updates to This Privacy Policy**

We may change our Services and policies, and we may need to make changes to this Privacy Policy so that they accurately reflect our Services and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to this Privacy Policy and allow you to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Privacy Policy. You can delete your account if you disagree with this or any revised Privacy Policy.

## **Cookies & Tracking Tools**

1.  **Use of Google Maps API**
    - Google Maps API is a robust tool that can be used to create a custom map, a searchable map, check-in functions, display live data synching with location, plan routes, or create a mashup, just to name a few.
    - Google Maps API may collect information from You and Your Device for security purposes.
    - Google Maps API collects information that its Privacy Policy holds

2.  **Cookie Information**
    - We may collect and use your information if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA). This section of our Privacy Policy explains exactly how and why this data is collected and how we protect it from replication or misuse.

## **GDPR Compliance Summary**

1.  GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law regulating how companies protect EU residents’ data companies and enhances the control EU residents have over their data.
2.  The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company, not just EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers’ data is essential irrespective of location, so we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.
3.  The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:
    - Personal data collected must be processed fairly, legally, and transparently and only used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.
    - Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and should only be used for that purpose. Organisations must specify why they need personal data when they collect it.
    - Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.
    - People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their data. They can also request a copy of their data and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organisation.

## **Your Rights: Access, Portability & Deletion**

1.  We are committed to helping our customers meet the GDPR’s data subject rights requirements. ProWorkforceX processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA-compliant vendors. We store all conversations and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In this case, we dispose of all data following our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it for longer than 60 days.
2.  We know that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to give them access to, update, retrieve, and remove personal data. We got you! We’ve been set up as self-service and have always given you access to your and your customers’ data. Our customer support team is here to answer any questions about working with the API.
