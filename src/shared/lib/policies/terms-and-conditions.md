3.  Without limiting the preceding, neither ProWorkforceX nor any ProWorkforceX provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on implied warranties or the applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.

You agree to indemnify and hold ProWorkforceX and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners, and licensors (if any) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, due to or arising out of your: (a) use of the website; (b) violation of this Agreement or any law or regulation; or (c) violation of any right of a third party.

## **Separability of Provisions**

1.  With the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by ProWorkforceX on the Services, this Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement between you and ProWorkforceX concerning the Services. Suppose any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction. In that case, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.
2.  No term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such or any other term. ProWorkforceX’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You and ProWorkforceX agree that any cause of action arising from or related to the services must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.

## **Waiver of Legal Rights**

Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require the performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not affect a party’s ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time after that, nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute waiver of any subsequent breach.

## **Full and Complete Agreement**

1.  The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and ProWorkforceX regarding your website use and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous written or oral agreements.
2.  You may be subject to additional Terms and Conditions when you use or purchase other ProWorkforceX services, which ProWorkforceX will provide at the time of such use or purchase.

## **Changes to the Agreement Terms**

## **Ownership of Intellectual Property**

1.  The website and its entire contents, features, and functionality (including but not limited to all information, software, text, displays, images, video and audio, and the design, selection, and arrangement thereof) are owned by ProWorkforceX, its licensors, or other providers of such material. The United Kingdom’s international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws protect them.

## **Arbitration for Dispute Resolution**

1.  This section applies to any dispute, except it does not include a dispute relating to claims for injunctive or equitable relief regarding the enforcement or validity of your or ProWorkforceX’s intellectual property rights.
2.  The term “dispute” means any dispute, action, or other controversies between you and ProWorkforceX concerning the Services or this agreement, whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis. “Dispute” will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.

## **Required Arbitration Process**

1.  Suppose you and ProWorkforceX do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation. In that case, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration, as described in this section. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury.
2.  The dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration by the commercial arbitration rules of the United Kingdom. Either party may seek any interim or preliminary injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect the party’s rights or property pending the completion of arbitration. The non-prevailing party shall bear all legal, accounting, and other costs, fees, and expenses incurred by the prevailing party.

## **Notification of Disputes**

In the event of a dispute, you or ProWorkforceX must give the other a Notice of Dispute, a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send any Notice of Dispute via email to [info@proworkforcex.com](mailto:info@proworkforcex.com). ProWorkforceX will send any Notice of Dispute to you by mail to your address if we have it or otherwise to your email address. You and ProWorkforceX will attempt to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, you or ProWorkforceX may commence arbitration.

## **Privacy Policy & Data Usage**

1.  If you submit or post any ideas, creative suggestions, designs, photographs, information, advertisements, data, or proposals, including ideas for new or improved products, services, features, technologies, or promotions, you expressly agree that such submissions will automatically be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and will become the sole property of ProWorkforceX without any compensation or credit to you whatsoever.
2.  ProWorkforceX and its affiliates shall have no obligations concerning such submissions or posts. They may use the ideas contained in such submissions or posts for any purposes in any medium in perpetuity, including, but not limited to, developing manufacturing and marketing products and services using such ideas.

If a product and/or service is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to a typographical error, we shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for the product and/or service listed at the incorrect price. We shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such order whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged.
